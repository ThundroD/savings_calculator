# savings_calculator
This is a JavaScript app that asks a series of questions that about income streams a person might have. It then uses JSON to display the income streams and totals. It then asks the user to add another source of income, which they can then add. Then the user is asked as series of questions about expenses. Using JSON the expenses are then displayed as well as totals. The user is then asked to add in another expense they have. After the app shows the user how much they take home monthly. It then asks the user how much they'd like to save per month. Once that is entered the app displays how much the user will have at the end of the month after expenses and savings.
